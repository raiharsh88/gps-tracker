# GPS Tracker using googles geo location API.

This project uses Googles Geolocation API .

##Overview

Googles Geolocation API offers accurate location data in terms of latitude and longitude with upto 25M of accuracy . 

This works when the client send the information such as mac address or Cell tower Id of nearest WiFi access points or cell towers , as a response to this data the
googles endpoint responds with the location data (co-ordinates) along with estimated accuracy.

My project consits of SIM 800L (GSM Module) and ESP8266-12F (Wifi Module and MicroController) along with a few sensors such as MPU6050 6 Axis (Accelerometer ,
